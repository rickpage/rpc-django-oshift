By default, when a file is uploaded using a FileField or ImageField,
it is saved to a file on a path inside the local directory named by MEDIA_ROOT,
 under a subdirectory named by the field's upload_to value. When the file's url
  attribute is accessed, it returns the value of MEDIA_URL, prepended to the
   file's path inside MEDIA_ROOT.
